IBUPROFEN - Complete Medication Guide

GENERIC NAME: Ibuprofen
BRAND NAMES: Advil, Motrin, Nurofen, Caldolor

DRUG CLASS: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)

MECHANISM OF ACTION:
Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are responsible for producing prostaglandins, which are chemical messengers that cause inflammation, pain, and fever in the body. By blocking these enzymes, ibuprofen reduces the production of prostaglandins, leading to decreased pain and inflammation.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:
- Mild to moderate pain relief (headache, toothache, backache)
- Fever reduction
- Inflammation reduction (arthritis, muscle strains)
- Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
- Minor aches and pains

DOSAGE GUIDELINES:
Adults and children over 12 years:
- 200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed
- Do not exceed 1200mg per day without doctor supervision
- Take with food or milk to reduce stomach upset

Children (under 12):
- Weight-based dosing: 5-10mg/kg every 6-8 hours
- Maximum: 40mg/kg per day

- Cardiovascular risk: May increase risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events
- Gastrointestinal risk: Can cause GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation
