WARFARIN - Complete Medication Guide

GENERIC NAME: Warfarin
BRAND NAMES: Coumadin, Jantoven

DRUG CLASS: Anticoagulant (Vitamin K Antagonist)

MECHANISM OF ACTION:
Warfarin inhibits the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is responsible for recycling vitamin K, which is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. By blocking this enzyme, warfarin reduces the production of these clotting factors, leading to a decreased ability for blood to clot. The full anticoagulant effect takes 3-5 days because existing clotting factors must naturally degrade.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:
- Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, DVT)
- Prophylaxis and treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Prevention of thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation
- Prevention of thromboembolic events after heart valve replacement
- Reduction of risk of recurrent myocardial infarction
- Prevention of stroke in patients with mechanical heart valves

DOSAGE GUIDELINES:
- Initial dose: 2-5 mg daily (based on patient factors)
- Maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily (individualized based on INR)
- Dose adjustments based on International Normalized Ratio (INR)
- Target INR depends on indication:
  * Most indications: 2.0-3.0
  * Mechanical heart valves: 2.5-3.5
- Take at same time each day (usually evening)

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
- Active bleeding or hemorrhagic tendencies
- Pregnancy (warfarin embryopathy, especially first trimester)
- Recent or upcoming surgery (including dental surgery)
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension
- Pericarditis or pericardial effusion
- Lumbar puncture or regional anesthesia
- Inability to comply with monitoring requirements

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
- Bleeding risk: Most serious adverse effect
- Monitoring: Regular INR testing required (initially weekly, then monthly)
- Dietary consistency: Vitamin K intake should be consistent
- Drug interactions: Hundreds of drugs interact with warfarin
- Genetic factors: CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants affect metabolism
- "Warfarin necrosis": Rare skin necrosis complication

COMMON SIDE EFFECTS:
- Bleeding (epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising)
- Purplish toes (cholesterol microembolization)
- Hair loss (reversible)
- Skin rash
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (seek immediate medical attention):
- Severe bleeding (internal, intracranial)
- Signs of bleeding: black stools, blood in urine, coffee-ground vomit
- Sudden severe headache (possible intracranial bleed)
- Unexplained bruising or swelling
- Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
- Purple toe syndrome

DRUG INTERACTIONS (SIGNIFICANT):
SEVERE INTERACTIONS:
1. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs: Increased bleeding risk
2. Aspirin: Significantly increased bleeding risk
3. Amiodarone: Increased warfarin effect (monitor INR closely)
4. Fluconazole (antifungals): Increased warfarin effect
5. Metronidazole: Increased warfarin effect
6. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: Increased warfarin effect

MODERATE INTERACTIONS:
1. Acetaminophen (high doses, regular use): Increased INR
2. Amoxicillin: Increased warfarin effect (disrupts gut flora)
3. Ciprofloxacin: Increased warfarin effect
4. Omeprazole: Possible increased warfarin effect
5. Simvastatin: Possible increased warfarin effect
6. Phenytoin: Complex bidirectional interaction
7. Alcohol (chronic heavy use): Variable effects

INTERACTIONS THAT DECREASE WARFARIN EFFECT:
1. Vitamin K (dietary supplements)
2. Rifampin
3. Barbiturates
4. Carbamazepine
5. Cholestyramine
6. Oral contraceptives

DIETARY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Consistent vitamin K intake is crucial
- Vitamin K rich foods: leafy greens (kale, spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts)
- Do not eliminate these foods, but keep intake consistent
- Avoid cranberry juice (may increase warfarin effect)
- Avoid alcohol (especially binge drinking)
- Avoid herbal supplements: St. John's wort, ginseng, ginkgo, coenzyme Q10

PHARMACOKINETICS:
- Absorption: Rapid and complete oral absorption
- Bioavailability: >95%
- Protein binding: 99% bound to albumin
- Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP2C9
- Half-life: 20-60 hours (average 40 hours)
- Onset of action: 24-72 hours
- Duration of action: 2-5 days
- Monitoring: INR (International Normalized Ratio)

LABORATORY MONITORING:
- INR target: Individualized (typically 2-3)
- Frequency: Initially daily to weekly, then every 4 weeks when stable
- Check INR before any surgical procedure
- Pregnancy: Warfarin contraindicated (heparin used instead)

PATIENT EDUCATION POINTS:
- Take exactly as prescribed at same time daily
- Missed dose: Take if remembered same day, otherwise skip
- Never double up doses
- Report any unusual bleeding or bruising
- Use soft toothbrush and electric razor
- Avoid contact sports
- Carry medical alert identification
- Inform all healthcare providers of warfarin use
- Keep all appointments for INR testing
- Do not start or stop any medication without consulting prescriber
