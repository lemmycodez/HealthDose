    "text": "AMOXICILLIN - Complete Medication Guide\n\nGENERIC NAME: Amoxicillin\nBRAND NAMES: Amoxil, Moxatag, Trimox\n\nDRUG CLASS: Penicillin Antibiotic (Aminopenicillin)\n\nMECHANISM OF ACTION:\nAmoxicillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) inside the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting the transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis. This weakens the cell wall and leads to osmotic lysis and death of susceptible bacteria. Amoxicillin is effective against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.\n\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE:\n- Upper respiratory infections: Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, otitis media\n- Lower respiratory infections: Bronchitis, pneumonia\n- Skin and skin structure infections\n- Urinary tract infections (UTI)\n- Helicobacter pylori eradication (with other medications)\n- Lyme disease (early stages)\n- Prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis (dental procedures)\n- Anthrax exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis)\n\nCOMMON BACTERIA COVERED:\n- Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- Streptococcus pyogenes\n- Haemophilus influenzae\n- Escherichia coli\n- Proteus mirabilis\n- Salmonella species\n- Enterococcus faecalis\n- Helicobacter pylori\n\nDOSAGE GUIDELINES:\nAdults:\n- Mild to moderate infections: 250-500 mg every 8 hours\n- Severe infections: 875 mg every 12 hours\n- Maximum dose: 2-3 grams per day\n\nChildren (based on weight):\n- 20-40 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours\n- 25-45 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours\n- Maximum: 2-3 grams per day\n\nSpecial populations:\n- Renal impairment: Dose adjustment required for CrCl <30 mL/min\n- Hemodialysis: Administer after dialysis\n- Elderly: Use normal adult dosing unless renal impairment\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS:\n- Known hypersensitivity to penicillins or beta-lactam antibiotics\n- History of severe allergic reaction to cephalosporins (cross-sensitivity)\n- Infectious mononucleosis (increased risk of rash)\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n- Anaphylaxis: Serious allergic reactions can occur (0.01-0.05% of courses)\n- Cross-sensitivity: 10% cross-sensitivity with cephalosporins\n- Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: Can occur during or after treatment\n- Superinfection: Prolonged use may cause fungal or bacterial overgrowth\n- Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction: In treatment of Lyme disease or syphilis\n- False-positive urine glucose tests (copper reduction method)\n\nCOMMON SIDE EFFECTS:\n- Diarrhea (most common, 5-10%)\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal pain\n- Rash (especially in patients with mononucleosis)\n- Vaginal yeast infection\n- Headache\n- Altered taste",

    "text": "WARFARIN - Complete Medication Guide\n\nGENERIC NAME: Warfarin\nBRAND NAMES: Coumadin, Jantoven\n\nDRUG CLASS: Anticoagulant (Vitamin K Antagonist)\n\nMECHANISM OF ACTION:\nWarfarin inhibits the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is responsible for recycling vitamin K, which is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver. By blocking this enzyme, warfarin reduces the production of these clotting factors, leading to a decreased ability for blood to clot. The full anticoagulant effect takes 3-5 days because existing clotting factors must naturally degrade.\n\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE:\n- Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, DVT)\n- Prophylaxis and treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE)\n- Prevention of thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation\n- Prevention of thromboembolic events after heart valve replacement\n- Reduction of risk of recurrent myocardial infarction\n- Prevention of stroke in patients with mechanical heart valves\n\nDOSAGE GUIDELINES:\n- Initial dose: 2-5 mg daily (based on patient factors)\n- Maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily (individualized based on INR)\n- Dose adjustments based on International Normalized Ratio (INR)\n- Target INR depends on indication:\n  * Most indications: 2.0-3.0\n  * Mechanical heart valves: 2.5-3.5\n- Take at same time each day (usually evening)\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS:\n- Active bleeding or hemorrhagic tendencies\n- Pregnancy (warfarin embryopathy, especially first trimester)\n- Recent or upcoming surgery (including dental surgery)\n- Severe uncontrolled hypertension\n- Pericarditis or pericardial effusion\n- Lumbar puncture or regional anesthesia\n- Inability to comply with monitoring requirements\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n- Bleeding risk: Most serious adverse effect\n- Monitoring: Regular INR testing required (initially weekly, then monthly)\n- Dietary consistency: Vitamin K intake should be consistent\n- Drug interactions: Hundreds of drugs interact with warfarin\n- Genetic factors: CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants affect metabolism\n- \"Warfarin necrosis\": Rare skin necrosis complication\n\nCOMMON SIDE EFFECTS:\n- Bleeding (epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising)\n- Purplish toes (cholesterol microembolization)\n- Hair loss (reversible)\n- Skin rash\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal pain\n\nSERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (seek immediate medical attention):\n- Severe bleeding (internal, intracranial)\n- Signs of bleeding: black stools, blood in urine, coffee-ground vomit\n- Sudden severe headache (possible intracranial bleed)\n- Unexplained bruising or swelling\n- Warfarin-induced skin necrosis\n- Purple toe syndrome",
